# Summative Task

## Overall goal

To make an interactive chemistry experience where you can make atoms that bounce around and bond with each other. This is focused on organic chemistry so it will only include Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.
The simulation will be completed in processing using java coding knowledge and organized through github. 

Using the keyboard the user can generate atoms that spawn at the mouse cursor with random velocities. They bounce off the edges of the screen and when they bounce off of each other they form bonds, if they are available. Carbon can bond 4 times, Oxygen can bond 2 times, and Hydrogen can bond once.

## Sub-goals

-Create an atom class that has properties of element, bonds numbers, size, and colour.
-Extend atom with oxygen, hydrogen, carbon
-Modify bouncer code to allow atoms to bond into molecules
-Possibly find a way to make double bonds?
