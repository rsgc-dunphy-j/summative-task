# Summative Task

## Overall goal

To make a game about going from a single carbon to a long, complex organic compound.
The game will be completed in processing using java coding knowledge and organized through github. 

Free floating, randomly generated atoms will be floating around in space and you, Carbon Chris need to gather electric potential and bond to them. Once all of your orbitals are filled, you get a game over and your score is recorded. The longer your carbon chain, the higher the score. 

## Sub-goals

-Create an atom class that has properties of element, bond numbers, size, and colour.
-Extend atom with oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and chlorine for bonus points*
-Extend carbon to make Carbon Chris the player character. 
-Create an environment with randomly appearing atoms on the edges
-Establish a scoring system for molecules
